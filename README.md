# 👋 Hi, I’m @bot-unit

### 🏗️ Integration Architect | AI Solutions & Autonomous Systems
For years, I’ve been bridging the gap between software and business. Today, I do the same, but with a new "engine": **Artificial Intelligence.**

---

### 🧠 My Focus
* **AI Orchestration:** I don't just prompt; I build systems where AI models act as operators to solve complex business logic.
* **Modern Integrations:** Moving beyond static APIs to dynamic, autonomous agentic workflows.
* **FinTech Implementation:** Applying high-performance tools (Rust, Java, Python) to the most demanding sector — trading bots and brokerage systems.

### 🛠️ The Toolkit (Vibe-Coding Ready)
I treat languages as specialized tools for specific integration tasks:
* **System Core:** Rust & Java (High-performance, reliable backends)
* **AI & Data:** Python (The glue for AI models and analytics)
* **Interfaces:** TypeScript (TSX) for modern, reactive frontends

### 🤖 Why It Matters
I specialize in **autonomous agent systems** — creating software that doesn't just process data, but reasons and iterates independently to achieve business goals.
